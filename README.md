⚠️ ChooChoo is currently under development. It has a planned release date of September 2022. Documentation is on its way soon-ish 🐢.

✨ ChooChoo encourages learning through self-assessment, collaboration and diagnostic teaching. You can read more about the pedagogy underlying ChooChoo here (TODO: link).
