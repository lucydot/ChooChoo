### Notes:

- Choochoo assumes that the repo is public
- for local testing need a .env file that should not be version controlled!
- the locomotive emoji is from: https://creazilla.com/nodes/54585-locomotive-emoji-clipart (creative commons with attribution, from Twitter)
- People management: the issue labels determine permissions for particular choochoo commands. Any thread with 'instructor' label can issue instructor commands, any thread with 'student' label can issue student commands. To add instructors or students to a project you can edit the settings.yml. Alternatively, instructors can use the choochoo command.
- Instructors are advised to create one repo for each class group
- Can't re-type choochoo commands by editing:  need to write a new issue comment
- Assumes that the repo is on main
