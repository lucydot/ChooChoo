ChooChoo is a **Ch**ecklist t**oo**l for educators  🚂

⚠️ ChooChoo is currently under development. It has a planned release date of September 2022.   
⚠️ Full documentation is on its way soon-ish 🐢  
⚠️ If you would like to beta-test ChooChoo for your own teaching, please [get in contact](https://lucydot.github.io/about/).  

## What is ChooChoo?
✨ ChooChoo encourages learning through student self-assessment, class collaboration and diagnostic teaching.

✨ Students and instructors interact with `choochoo-bot` through a Github issue thread. This makes ChooChoo especially relevant to those who already teach using Github. It's also a great way to introduce your students to the wonderful world of Git, Github and version control!

✨ ChooChoo is free to use and adapt under a Creative Commons License.

*Pretty-please* say hi :wave: if you are using ChooChoo - you can find my email address [here](https://lucydot.github.io/about/). If I know people are using it, I'm more likely to do my housework (sweeping out the old dusty code, polishing up the documentation 🧹).
