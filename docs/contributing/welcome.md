## Project description

ChooChoo is a Checklist Tool for educators. ChooChoo encourages learning through self-assessment, collaboration and diagnostic teaching. Instructors can create checklists for their students to work through, linked to a question bank and tutorials. Students can make contributions to the question bank, and review the contributions of their peers. Real-time plots are used to summarise class progress and better target teaching towards the topics that students are struggling with.

## Issue tracker

The [ChooChoo issue tracker](https://github.com/lucydot/ChooChoo/issues/) is used to maintain a to-do list for [ChooChoo](https://github.com/lucydot/ChooChoo/) and [ChooChoo-template](https://github.com/lucydot/ChooChoo-template/) improvements. If you have found a bug or have a suggested improvement that is not listed, consider [raising an issue](https://github.com/lucydot/ChooChoo/issues/new/choose).
