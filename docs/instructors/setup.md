For more details please select a tab below.



!!! Note

    Your ChooChoo repo should be public if you have standard (free) Github account and want to publish tutorials, questions and summary plots.


People management: the issue labels determine permissions for particular choochoo commands. Any thread with 'instructor' label can issue instructor commands, any thread with 'student' label can issue student commands. To add instructors or students to a project you can edit the settings.yml. Alternatively, instructors can use the choochoo command.

Instructors are advised to create one repo for each class group
Can't re-type choochoo commands by editing: need to write a new issue comment

Choochoo is a "fork-and-go" project

Automatically assumes branch names but this can be edited

Note delay in running an action adn the un-intended consequences this may have (for example, building the checklist after adding links)
