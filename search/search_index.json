Any thread with 'instructor' label can issue instructor commands, any thread with 'student' label can issue student commands. To add instructors or students to a project you can edit the settings.yml. Alternatively, instructors can use the choochoo command. Instructors are advised to create one repo for each class group Can't re-type choochoo commands by editing: need to write a new issue comment Automatically assumes branch names but this can be edited Only one webpage of questions per username See some comments in the code - need to run through and move here / to the issues tracker.
