You can read more about the pedagogy underlying ChooChoo here (TODO: link). \u2728 Students and instructors interact with ChooChoo-bot through a Github issue thread. This makes ChooChoo especially relevant to those who already teach using Github. It's also a great way to introduce your students to the wonderful world of Git, Github and version control! \u2728 ChooChoo is free to use and adapt under a Creative Commons License.

ChooChoo encourages learning through self-assessment, collaboration and diagnostic teaching. If you would like to know more about the pedagogy underlying ChooChoo please read the Pedagogy page . If you use ChooChoo as part of any published work, please cite accordingly . ChooChoo target audience ChooChoo is domain agnostic. It is primarily aimed at people who already use Github for their teaching, and who would like a straight-forward way to assess the progress of their students. It can be integrated into an existing Github repository, or exist as a standalone project. We strongly encourage people to share their ChooChoo repositories so that others can use and adapt existing checklists and question sets. For example, the ChooChoo-physics repository can be easily adapted for use in other undergraduate computational physics courses. A full list of ChooChoo projects is maintained here . Which skills are needed to use ChooChoo? ChooChoo is based around Github and, in particular, Github Issues. Self-assessment questions (an optional feature) are written using Markdown syntax. In addition, instructors use yaml to set the ChooChoo checklists and settings. All three tools (Github, Markdown, yaml) are very widely used within the programming community. Learning these skills will, in many cases, be a worthwhile time investment for those who continue to work in technology-related fields. To learn more about the tools that ChooChoo is built on top of please read the [Tools page]. ChooChoo-bot Students and instructors interact with the ChooChoo-bot helper using comments in a Github issue thread. All comments starting with choochoo will be received by ChooChoo-bot. ChooChoo roles and issue types There are three roles within a ChooChoo project: admin , instructor and student : - Students can generate personal checklists to work through, propose self-assessment questions and vote on proposed questions. - Instructors can add or remove students, summarise class progress as a bar chart, and add questions to the question bank. - Admins can do the same as instructors, in addition they are able to generate the student checklist template and add/remove instructors. Documentation for students can be found in the student section . We suggest linking to this from any associated course pages. Documentation for admins and instructors can be found in the instructor section . There are also three ChooChoo issue types: student , instructor and question_proposal . - student issues can by a student, instructor or admin. They contain an automatically generated, personal checklist for the student to work through. They also contain links to any associated tutorials, questions or external websites. - instructor issues can be created by an instructor or admin. They are used to monitor class progress (generate plots) and add/remove students. - question_proposal issues can be created by a student, instructor or admin. They contain the proposed question. They also contain any discussion about the question and the votes in support of the question. The table below summarises the choochoo-bot commands, who can use each command, and where each command can be used. A summary of the available student commands is available here .

To add instructors or students to a project you can edit the settings.yml. Alternatively, instructors can use the choochoo command. Instructors are advised to create one repo for each class group Can't re-type choochoo commands by editing: need to write a new issue comment Automatically assumes branch names but this can be edited Only one webpage of questions per username See some comments in the code - need to run through and move here / to the issues tracker.
