ChooChoo encourages learning through self-assessment, collaboration and diagnostic teaching. If you would like to know more about the pedagogy underlying ChooChoo please read the Pedagogy page . Warning If you use ChooChoo as part of any published work, please cite accordingly . ChooChoo target audience ChooChoo is domain agnostic. It is primarily aimed at people who already use Github for their teaching, and who would like a straight-forward way to assess the progress of their students. It can be integrated into an existing Github repository, or exist as a standalone project. A list of ChooChoo projects is maintained here . Sharing is caring Users are strongly encouraged to share their ChooChoo repositories. This will enable other people to start from existing checklists and question sets and will make setup quicker over time. Sharing can also incentivise student participation in building the question bank, as their work will have impact beyond a single institution. Which skills are needed to use ChooChoo? ChooChoo is based around Github and, in particular, Github Issues. Self-assessment questions (an optional feature) are written using Markdown syntax. In addition, instructors use yaml to specify the ChooChoo checklists and settings. All three tools (Github, Markdown, yaml) are very widely used within the programming community. Learning these skills will, in many cases, be a worthwhile time investment for those who continue to work in technology-related fields. To learn more about the tools that ChooChoo is built on top of please read the Tools page . choochoo-bot Students and instructors interact with the choochoo-bot helper using comments in a Github issue thread. All comments starting with choochoo will be received by choochoo-bot . ChooChoo roles There are three roles within a ChooChoo project: student , instructor and admin : A student can generate personal checklists to work through, propose self-assessment questions and vote on proposed questions. An instructor can do the same as a student, plus summarise class progress as a bar chart and add/remove students. An admin can do the same as an instructor, plus generate the Github issue templates, add questions to the question bank and add/remove instructors. ChooChoo issue types There are three ChooChoo issue types: student , instructor and [optional] question . A student issue can be created by a student, instructor or admin. It contains an automatically generated, personal checklist to work through. It also contains links to any associated tutorials, questions or external websites. An instructor issue can be created by an instructor or admin. It is used for general ChooChoo management: for example, to monitor class progress (generate plots), add/remove students or generate the Github issue templates. [optional] A question issue can be created by a student, instructor or admin. Its contain a proposed question for the question bank. It also contains any discussion about the question and tracks the votes in support of accepting the question to the question bank.

If you make a mistake it is best to create a new comment in the issue thread. You can always delete comments if you would like the issue thread to look less cluttered. 3. Manage class participants You can add students and instructors using choochoo add [@handle] as student or choochoo add [@handle] as instructor . @handle is the Github username of the student/instructor. You can remove students and instructors using choochoo remove [@handle] as student or choochoo remove [@handle] as instructor . If you are an admin you can add and remove other admins using choochoo add [@handle] as admin or choochoo remove [@handle] as admin . To list all students, instructors and admins use choochoo list people . Hint There is often more than one way to do something in ChooChoo. For example: to add a student to the repo an instructor or admin could use the command choochoo add @handle as instructor . Alternatively, they could edit ./instructor/settings.yml directly. In this sense, many of the ChooChoo instructor commands can be seen as convenience functions. 4. Add links to the objectives You can add any link (an external tutorial, Youtube video etc) to a particular objective using the command choochoo add link [webpage address] to objective [positive integer] . The objective number can be found in any student issue thread. Alternatively, you can also add a link by directly editing ./instructor/objectives.yml .

Get ChooChoo files There are three ways to get the files required to run ChooChoo: Fork the choochoo-template repository and specify the objectives/questions/tutorials for your course. Fork an existing choochoo repository and use or extend objectives/questions/tutorials from an existing ChooChoo project. Integrate ChooChoo into an existing Github repository. The third option (integrate) requires a good understanding of Github. If you are new to Github we recommend forking the choochoo-template or an existing choochoo repository .

If you are new to Github we recommend forking an existing choochoo repository or the template repository. Note You can copy the ChooChoo files into a dedicated branch if preferred. Just be sure to specify the branch in ./instructor/settings.yml . Visit https://github.com/lucydot/ChooChoo-template/ Copy the ./instructor folder and contents into the root of your repository Create an empty ./plots folder in the root your repository [optional] Create an empty ./questions folder in the root of your repository [optional] Create an empty ./tutorials folder in the root of your repository Copy the contents of .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/ into your repository. You may need to create this folder if it does not already exist. Copy the contents of .github/workflows/ into your repository. You may need to create this folder if it does not already exist. Note Your ChooChoo repo should be public if you have standard (free) Github account and want to publish tutorials, questions and summary plots online. You are advised to create one ChooChoo repository for each class group. This will allow you to track the progress of each individual class rather than all classes combined. 2. Set repository permissions You need to enable workflows on the forked repository. To do this: 1. Visit your repository (most likely at github.com/username/repo_name/) 2. click on the Actions tab towards the top of the page 3. Click on I understand my workflows, go ahead and enable them Commands to choochoo-bot trigger a Github Action workflow. Permissions are needed to edit the repository during the workflow run. By default the workflow uses secrets.BOT_ACCESS_TOKEN , which requires a BOT_ACCESS_TOKEN to be added to your repository secrets. To do this please get in contact through the ChooChoo discussion page or email . Alternatively you can use the secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN which is automatically generated during any workflow run. The disadvantage of this approach is that choochoo-bot is replaced by the less charming gh-actions bot. To do this nonetheless: 1. Visit your repository (most likely at github.com/username/repo_name/) 2. For each file in the .github/workflows/ directory, replace all instances of secrets.BOT_ACCESS_TOKEN with secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN . 3.

Take a look at existing ChooChoo question banks for inspiration. Voting for a question Students are also allowed to propose questions using the Question thread issue form. ChooChoo participants can then vote their support for a question using the command choochoo vote up in the corresponding issue thread. When a certain number of votes are reached (determined by the votes_required option in ./instructor/settings.yml ), the admins will be mentioned in the issue thread. To accept and publish this student contribution follow steps 4 to 9 in Step 6 above. Course chit-chat Feel free to use the Github issue comments to discuss the question. The comment boxes aren't only for choochoo commands.
